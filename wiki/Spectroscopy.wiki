Buttons
*Run until stop 
*Start scan
*Display current grating, allow set grating

Features
*Combined control/scan panel
*Graph as you go
*Scan up, and scan back down (don't reset to low wavelength, just scan down)
*Current day's data directory

Calculate
*Specify step size <-> #points inferred
*Display estimated scan time
*Slit width to optimal step size, vice versa
**250,500: 0.1mmslits = 0.6nm*wavelength
**2500: 0.1mm slits = 2.4nm*wavelength

Drivers
*Let user select R or X on cabinet, instead of only reading X
